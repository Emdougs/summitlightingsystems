## ❓ FAQ (Objection handling)

### 1) Does it look noticeable during the day?
Chromaglow Pro is designed to be **discrete** on the roofline, with tracks/channels intended to keep the install looking clean and “built-in” rather than seasonal décor. We color-match and place the system to minimize visibility from the street where possible.

### 2) Can you do warm white only?
Yes. Chromaglow Pro is **RGBW**, which includes a dedicated white channel. We can set you up with **warm-white-only** daily schedules, and you still have full color available for holidays or special events.

### 3) How do controls and scheduling work?
You control the system through the **Chromaglow Pro mobile app**, including presets, scenes, brightness, and **scheduled automation**. The system is smart-home friendly and compatible with **Alexa** and **Google Home**.

### 4) How long does installation take?
Your quote includes a clear estimate for **total project cost** and **how long the install will take**. Many homes can be completed in a day; larger or more complex rooflines can take longer. We confirm timelines after measuring and design.

### 5) What happens if a section fails?
Chromaglow Pro light strings are designed to be **cut and spliced**, which makes repairs straightforward when needed. We diagnose the issue, isolate the segment, and repair/replace using the manufacturer’s system components.

### 6) Is it safe / low voltage?
Yes. Chromaglow Pro is a **48V low-voltage** system and is described by the manufacturer as plug-and-play (no manipulation of the 120V side of the system). Local permit requirements can vary by municipality.

### 7) Can I expand coverage later?
Usually, yes. The system is designed to scale: a controller can manage **up to 1,500 ft of lights**, and you can expand by adding additional power supplies/controllers as needed (which can be synced).

### 8) How do you handle steep roofs and hard access?
We plan the install around safe access. Our crew is **certified in fall protection** and **mobile elevating work platform (MEWP) operation**, and we use the right approach for the roofline—ladder, lift, or alternate mounting strategy—based on the site.

### 9) What’s included in the quote?
Your quote includes:
- A measured lighting plan (coverage + layout assumptions)
- An estimate of the **full cost** of the job
- An estimate of **how long the job will take** to complete
- Warranty clarity: manufacturer parts coverage (Chromaglow Pro / Big Star Lights) + SUMMIT workmanship terms
